pg-console is a lightweight PostgreSQL monitoring and performance dashboard that provides real-time insights into your database activity, query performance, and system health.

== What is pg-console?

pg-console is a web-based monitoring dashboard for PostgreSQL databases that leverages PostgreSQL's built-in statistics views to provide comprehensive insights without requiring additional database modifications or extensions beyond `pg_stat_statements`.

Built with modern web technologies including Quarkus, Qute templating, and htmx, pg-console delivers a responsive, server-side rendered interface that works seamlessly with or without JavaScript enabled.
