== Overview Dashboard

The overview dashboard (`/`) provides a real-time summary of your PostgreSQL instance health.

=== Widgets

==== Active Connections

Displays the current number of active database connections.

* *Metric*: Count from `pg_stat_activity` where state is 'active'
* *Colour coding*:
  - Green: Normal activity
  - Yellow: Elevated connection count (approaching max_connections)
  - Red: Critical connection count

==== Active Queries

Shows queries currently executing.

* *Metric*: Count of non-idle connections in `pg_stat_activity`
* Excludes idle connections and background processes

==== Blocked Queries

Highlights queries waiting on locks.

* *Metric*: Count from `pg_stat_activity` where `wait_event_type = 'Lock'`
* Red indicator when blocked queries detected
* Click to view xref:#locks-dashboard[Locks dashboard]

==== Cache Hit Ratio

Database buffer cache effectiveness percentage.

* *Formula*: `(cache hits / (cache hits + disk reads)) × 100`
* *Source*: `pg_stat_database`
* *Optimal range*: 95% or higher
* Values below 90% may indicate insufficient `shared_buffers`

==== Database Size

Total size of all monitored databases.

* *Metric*: Sum of `pg_database_size()` for all databases
* Displayed in human-readable format (MB, GB, TB)

==== Top Tables by Size

Largest tables in the database.

* *Columns*:
  - Table name
  - Schema
  - Total size (table + indexes + TOAST)
  - Row count estimate
* Click table name to view detailed statistics

==== Top Indexes by Size

Largest indexes in the database.

* *Columns*:
  - Index name
  - Table name
  - Index size
  - Index type (btree, gin, gist, etc.)

=== Sparklines

When xref:configuration.adoc#history-sampling[history sampling] is enabled, widgets display SVG sparklines showing trends over the configured retention period:

* *Green line*: Metric within normal range
* *Orange line*: Metric elevated
* *Red line*: Metric critical

Hover over sparklines to see approximate values at different time points.

== Slow Queries Dashboard

The slow queries dashboard (`/slow-queries`) analyses query performance using PostgreSQL's `pg_stat_statements` extension.

=== Prerequisites

This dashboard requires the xref:installation.adoc#pg-stat-statements[pg_stat_statements extension] to be enabled.

=== Query List

Displays all tracked queries sorted by total execution time (default).

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Column |Description

|Query
|Normalised query text (parameters replaced with placeholders)

|Calls
|Number of times the query has been executed

|Total Time
|Cumulative execution time across all calls

|Mean Time
|Average execution time per call

|Min Time
|Fastest execution time

|Max Time
|Slowest execution time

|Rows
|Average number of rows returned per call
|===

=== Sorting

Click any column header to sort by that metric:

* *Total Time*: Find queries consuming the most cumulative time
* *Mean Time*: Identify individually slow queries
* *Max Time*: Detect queries with occasional slowness
* *Calls*: Find most frequently executed queries

The sort order toggles between ascending and descending on repeated clicks.

=== Query Details

Click any query row to view detailed statistics on a dedicated page (`/slow-queries/{queryId}`).

==== Detailed Metrics

* *Execution Statistics*:
  - Total calls
  - Total execution time
  - Mean, minimum, maximum execution time
  - Standard deviation

* *I/O Statistics*:
  - Shared blocks hit (cache)
  - Shared blocks read (disk)
  - Shared blocks dirtied (writes)
  - Shared blocks written

* *Row Statistics*:
  - Total rows returned
  - Average rows per execution

* *Buffer Statistics*:
  - Local blocks hit/read/written
  - Temp blocks read/written

==== Copy Query

The *Copy Query* button copies the full query text to your clipboard for analysis or execution in a SQL client.

=== Resetting Statistics

To reset `pg_stat_statements` data:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT pg_stat_statements_reset();
----

[WARNING]
====
Resetting clears all historical query statistics. This operation cannot be undone.
====

== Activity Dashboard

The activity dashboard (`/activity`) shows current database connections and executing queries in real-time.

=== Connection List

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Column |Description

|PID
|PostgreSQL backend process ID

|Database
|Connected database name

|User
|Database user name

|Application
|Client application name (from `application_name` parameter)

|State
|Connection state (active, idle, idle in transaction, etc.)

|Query
|Currently executing query (truncated)

|Duration
|How long the current query has been running

|Wait Event
|What the backend is waiting for (lock, I/O, etc.)
|===

=== Connection States

* *active* - Currently executing a query
* *idle* - Connected but not executing a query
* *idle in transaction* - In a transaction but not executing a query
* *idle in transaction (aborted)* - Transaction failed but not rolled back

=== Identifying Problems

==== Long-Running Queries

Queries with high duration values may indicate:

* Missing indexes
* Table locks
* Inefficient query plans
* Large data scans

==== Idle in Transaction

Connections in "idle in transaction" state hold locks and prevent vacuum from reclaiming space. These often indicate:

* Application connection pool issues
* Forgotten transactions in application code
* Client disconnections without proper cleanup

[TIP]
====
Configure `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` in PostgreSQL to automatically terminate long-idle transactions:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER DATABASE myapp SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '10min';
----
====

=== Terminating Connections

To terminate a problematic connection from PostgreSQL:

[source,sql]
----
-- Graceful termination
SELECT pg_cancel_backend(PID);

-- Force termination (if cancel doesn't work)
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(PID);
----

Replace `PID` with the process ID from the activity dashboard.

[[locks-dashboard]]
== Locks Dashboard

The locks dashboard (`/locks`) visualises lock contention and blocking relationships.

=== Lock Summary

Overview of current locks grouped by type:

* *AccessShareLock* - `SELECT` queries
* *RowShareLock* - `SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE`
* *RowExclusiveLock* - `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
* *ShareUpdateExclusiveLock* - `VACUUM`, `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`
* *ShareLock* - `CREATE INDEX`
* *ExclusiveLock* - Blocks most operations
* *AccessExclusiveLock* - `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `ALTER TABLE`

=== Blocking Tree

The blocking tree visualises blocking relationships between queries:

[source,text]
----
PID 1234 (GRANTED) - UPDATE accounts SET balance = 100
  └─ PID 5678 (WAITING) - UPDATE accounts SET balance = 200
       └─ PID 9012 (WAITING) - SELECT * FROM accounts FOR UPDATE
----

* *GRANTED* - Lock holder (blocking other queries)
* *WAITING* - Waiting for lock to be released

=== Resolving Deadlocks

When multiple queries form a circular wait chain:

. Identify the root blocker (top of the blocking tree)
. Review the blocking query to determine if it's:
  - A long-running transaction
  - An idle transaction holding locks
  - A legitimate operation that needs to complete
. Consider terminating the blocker using `pg_cancel_backend()` or `pg_terminate_backend()`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Terminating a query will roll back its transaction. Ensure this is acceptable before proceeding.
====

== Tables Dashboard

The tables dashboard (`/tables`) provides statistics on table and index usage.

=== Table Statistics

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Column |Description

|Table
|Table name

|Schema
|Schema name

|Rows
|Estimated row count

|Size
|Total size (table + indexes + TOAST)

|Seq Scans
|Number of sequential scans

|Index Scans
|Number of index scans

|Inserts
|Number of rows inserted

|Updates
|Number of rows updated

|Deletes
|Number of rows deleted

|Hot Updates
|Number of HOT (Heap-Only Tuple) updates

|Dead Rows
|Estimated dead row count

|Last Vacuum
|Timestamp of last vacuum operation

|Last Autovacuum
|Timestamp of last autovacuum
|===

=== Identifying Issues

==== High Dead Row Count

Tables with many dead rows may need tuning:

* Increase `autovacuum_work_mem`
* Decrease `autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`
* Run manual `VACUUM` during low-traffic periods

==== Excessive Sequential Scans

Tables with high `seq_scans` relative to `index_scans` may benefit from:

* Adding indexes on frequently queried columns
* Analysing queries using `EXPLAIN` to identify missing indexes

==== Low HOT Update Ratio

When `hot_updates` is much lower than `updates`, consider:

* Reducing table bloat with `VACUUM FULL` (requires table lock)
* Increasing `fillfactor` for the table to allow more HOT updates

==== Table Bloat

Bloat occurs when `dead_rows` accumulate faster than vacuum can remove them:

. Check `last_autovacuum` timestamp
. If vacuum hasn't run recently, check autovacuum settings
. Consider manual `VACUUM` or `VACUUM FULL` (requires exclusive lock)

=== Index Statistics

View index-specific metrics by scrolling to the index section:

* *Index scans*: Number of times the index was used
* *Rows read*: Total rows fetched via the index
* *Size*: Disk space consumed

Unused indexes (zero scans) can be candidates for removal to reduce maintenance overhead.

== Databases Dashboard

The databases dashboard (`/databases`) compares metrics across all monitored databases.

=== Database Metrics

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Column |Description

|Database
|Database name

|Size
|Total database size

|Connections
|Current connection count

|Transactions
|Total committed + rolled back transactions

|Cache Hit Ratio
|Buffer cache hit percentage

|Blocks Read
|Disk blocks read

|Blocks Hit
|Cache blocks hit

|Tuples Returned
|Rows returned by queries

|Tuples Fetched
|Rows fetched by queries

|Tuples Inserted
|Rows inserted

|Tuples Updated
|Rows updated

|Tuples Deleted
|Rows deleted

|Conflicts
|Query conflicts (streaming replication standbys)

|Temp Files
|Number of temporary files created

|Temp Bytes
|Temporary file size

|Deadlocks
|Number of deadlocks detected
|===

=== Database Detail View

Click any database name to view a detailed dashboard (`/databases/{dbName}`) with:

* Historical sparklines for key metrics (if history sampling enabled)
* Top queries specific to that database
* Per-table statistics
* Connection breakdown by application

=== Filtering Databases

To limit which databases appear in this dashboard, use the xref:configuration.adoc#database-filtering[PG_CONSOLE_DATABASES] environment variable.

== About Dashboard

The about dashboard (`/about`) displays system and version information:

* *Application Version*: pg-console release version
* *PostgreSQL Version*: Connected server version and build details
* *pg_stat_statements*: Extension version and status
* *History Sampling*: Enabled/disabled status
* *Connection URL*: JDBC URL (password redacted)

Use this page to verify configuration and troubleshoot connection issues.

== Dashboard Features

=== Auto-Refresh

All dashboards support automatic refresh to display real-time data.

To enable auto-refresh:

. Click the *Auto-Refresh* dropdown in the navigation bar
. Select an interval:
  - *Off* (default)
  - *5 seconds*
  - *10 seconds*
  - *30 seconds*
  - *60 seconds*

The selection is persisted in browser `localStorage` and applies to all dashboards.

[NOTE]
====
Aggressive auto-refresh intervals (5s, 10s) increase database query load. For production monitoring of high-traffic databases, use 30s or 60s intervals.
====

=== Dark Mode Toggle

pg-console supports light and dark colour schemes.

To toggle dark mode:

. Click the *Dark Mode* button (moon icon) in the navigation bar
. The preference is stored in browser `localStorage`

The theme applies to all dashboards and persists across browser sessions.

=== Column Sorting

Dashboards with tabular data support sorting:

. Click a column header to sort by that column
. Click again to reverse sort order
. An arrow indicator shows the current sort column and direction

Sorting is implemented server-side with validated allowlists to prevent SQL injection.

=== Progressive Enhancement

pg-console uses htmx for dynamic interactions:

* Works without JavaScript (graceful degradation)
* Auto-refresh and sorting use htmx when available
* All features accessible via full page loads if JavaScript is disabled
