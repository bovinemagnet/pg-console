:keywords: postgresql, monitoring, dashboard, user guide

[abstract]
This user guide provides comprehensive instructions for installing, configuring, and using pg-console to monitor your PostgreSQL database instances.

== What is pg-console?

pg-console is a lightweight, server-side rendered PostgreSQL monitoring dashboard built with Quarkus, Qute templating, and htmx. It provides real-time insights into database performance, slow queries, active connections, lock contention, and table statistics without requiring client-side JavaScript frameworks.

== Key Features

* *Real-time Monitoring* - Live dashboard with auto-refresh capabilities (5s/10s/30s/60s intervals)
* *Query Performance Analysis* - Identify slow queries using `pg_stat_statements` with detailed execution statistics
* *Connection Activity* - Monitor current database connections and active queries
* *Lock Detection* - Visualise lock contention and blocking trees to identify deadlock scenarios
* *Table Statistics* - Track table bloat, index usage, and vacuum activity
* *Historical Trends* - Optional history sampling with SVG sparklines for metrics over time
* *Multi-Database Support* - Monitor multiple databases with per-database metrics comparison
* *Dark Mode* - Toggle between light and dark themes with persistent preference
* *Zero JavaScript Build* - Works without JavaScript; htmx provides progressive enhancement

== Who Should Use This Guide?

This guide is designed for:

* *Database Administrators* - Monitor production PostgreSQL instances and troubleshoot performance issues
* *DevOps Engineers* - Integrate pg-console into monitoring infrastructure
* *Developers* - Analyse query performance during development and testing
* *System Administrators* - Install and configure pg-console for team use
